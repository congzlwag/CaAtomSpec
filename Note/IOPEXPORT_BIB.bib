	journal = {Proceedings of the Physical Society},
	abstract = {The dipole polarizabilities of four closed-shell ions, Na+, Mg2+, K+ and Ca2+, are evaluated from observed spectra, using theoretical values of the quadrupole polarizabilities taken from the literature and including a number of corrections, in particular a non-adiabatic correction and perturbation corrections up to the fourth order. These additional, previously neglected, corrections are partly positive and partly negative, and nearly cancel each other: consequently the results, in which the probable error is about 1%, are close to results previously obtained from observed spectra.}
